# Matrix Operations Program

This program performs various operations on matrices, including filling, printing, transposing, and multiplying matrices.

## Program Description

The program consists of the following functions:

1. `fillMatrix`: Fills a matrix with random integer values.
2. `printMatrix`: Prints the elements of a matrix.
3. `transposeMatrix`: Transposes a matrix.
4. `multiplyMatrix`: Multiplies two matrices.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation**: Compile the program using any C compiler (e.g., gcc).
   ```
   gcc -o matrix_operations matrix_operations.c
   ```

2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable.
   ```
   ./matrix_operations
   ```

## Usage

1. **Fill Matrix (Q1)**: Fills a matrix with random integer values.
2. **Print Matrix (Q2)**: Prints the elements of a matrix.
3. **Transpose Matrix (Q3)**: Transposes a matrix.
4. **Multiply Matrix (Q4)**: Multiplies two matrices.

## Example Output

The program demonstrates the usage of each operation with sample input matrices.
